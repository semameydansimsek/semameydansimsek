## ABOUT ME 
Hello, I'm Sema, I'm passionate about data analysis and information management. In addition to my banking career, I develop data analysis with trainings such as Excel, SQL and Python, and during my ongoing bootcamp process, I can effectively process and analyze large data sets in projects with Excel. I can examine data sets that contain pivot tables, lines, and complex formulas. I improved my ability to extract, corrupt and query data from databases in SQL. I also have experience in data analysis and data visualization with Python. I developed the ability to automate data manipulation and analysis using libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib. I share my projects and technical information on my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles. You can reach me on LinkedIn.
